### Hi, I'm [Matheus Kubrusly] 👋

I'm a student and team lead with a deep passion for computer science, from the hardware up. My main interests lie in **operating systems development**, **digital logic**, and **computer architecture**.

I'm comfortable with low-level systems programming in **C** and also have experience in **Java**. I'm currently applying these skills to a personal project: building a **custom operating system** for a portable console. I also enjoy using **PlantUML** to design and visualize complex software systems.
